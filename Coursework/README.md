# Coursework Description
Text Analytics Coursework with Python, which mainly focused on Chinese and English natural language processing modeling, from bad-of-words, sentiment analysis, topic model, word embedding to basic supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms as well as statistical analytics (e.g. Chi-Square, Mutual Information, etc).
